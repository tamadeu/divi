# Tech Stack

- You are building a React application.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use React Router. KEEP the routes in src/App.tsx
- Always put source code in the src folder.
- Put pages into src/pages/
- Put components into src/components/
- The main page (default page) is src/pages/Index.tsx
- UPDATE the main page to include the new components. OTHERWISE, the user can NOT see any components!
- ALWAYS try to use the shadcn/ui library.
- Tailwind CSS: always use Tailwind CSS for styling components. Utilize Tailwind classes extensively for layout, spacing, colors, and other design aspects.

Available packages and libraries:

- The lucide-react package is installed for icons.
- You ALREADY have ALL the shadcn/ui components and their dependencies installed. So you don't need to install them again.
- You have ALL the necessary Radix UI components installed.
- Use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after importing them. Note that these files shouldn't be edited, so make new components if you need to change them.

When making any changes to the database schema, structure, or functionality, ensure all modifications are backwards compatible. This means:

Existing applications and queries must continue to work without modification
New columns should have default values or be nullable
Don't remove or rename existing tables, columns, or constraints
Don't change data types in ways that break existing code
The goal is to avoid breaking any systems that rely on the current database structure while still allowing new features to be added.

Security:
Always code according the owasp protocols
